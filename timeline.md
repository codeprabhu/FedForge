# Day 5 — Platform Containerization

✅ Complete

Dockerized:

* Coordinator
* Worker

Docker Compose Services:

* Container startup flow
* Worker registration resilience
* Exponential backoff
* Registration retry logic
* Jitter-based retries

Verified:

```text
docker compose up
↓
postgres starts
↓
coordinator starts
↓
worker registers
↓
heartbeats begin
```

Additional Achievement:

Workers no longer depend on coordinator startup ordering.

Workers recover automatically when coordinator becomes available.

Success Criteria:

✅ Full platform launches through Docker Compose

✅ Worker auto-registers

✅ Heartbeats function inside containers

✅ Coordinator-worker networking verified

---

# Day 6 — Task Architecture

✅ Complete
## Objective

Introduce the concept of distributed work.

Current workers can:

```text
Register
Heartbeat
Exist
```

Workers cannot yet:

```text
Execute Tasks
```

This day introduces the foundation that every future training operation will use.

---
Implemented:

- Task ORM
- TaskStatus Enum
- TaskType Enum
- TaskRegistry
- PostgresTaskRepository
- Task API
- Task Lifecycle State Machine
- Lifecycle Validation
- Database Bootstrap Integration
- ORM-Based Repositories

---

## Initial Task Type

Implement:

```text
EchoTask
```

Example:
# Day 6 — Task Architecture

✅ Complete

## Objectives

Introduce the concept of distributed work.

Workers can now participate in task lifecycle management.

---

## Implemented

### Task System

Created:

```text
Task ORM
TaskStatus Enum
TaskType Enum
TaskRegistry
PostgresTaskRepository
Task API
```

Task States:

```text
CREATED
ASSIGNED
RUNNING
COMPLETED
FAILED
CANCELLED
```

Task Types:

```text
ECHO
TRAINING
```

---

## Task Lifecycle

Implemented:

```text
CREATED
↓
ASSIGNED
↓
RUNNING
↓
COMPLETED
```

Failure Path:

```text
ASSIGNED/RUNNING
↓
FAILED
```

Illegal state transitions are rejected through lifecycle validation inside TaskRegistry.

---

## Architectural Refactor

Refactored repositories to return ORM objects instead of dictionaries.

Result:

```text
Repositories
↓
ORM Models
↓
Services
```

Benefits:

* Cleaner domain model
* Less mapping code
* Better SQLAlchemy integration
* Consistent architecture between workers, tasks, and events

---

## Database Bootstrap

Integrated:

```python
create_tables()
```

into coordinator startup.

Result:

```bash
docker compose up
```

automatically creates missing tables.

Alembic migrations intentionally deferred until schema stabilization.

---

## SQLAlchemy Flush Discovery

Issue:

```text
Tasks created inside a transaction
could not be immediately retrieved.
```

Root Cause:

```text
Session.add()
does not flush SQL statements.
```

Resolution:

Repositories now perform:

```python
db.add(entity)
db.flush()
```

Result:

```text
Entities become queryable
inside the same transaction
before commit.
```

---

## Verification Completed

Verified:

```text
Task creation
Task retrieval
Task persistence
Task lifecycle transitions
Illegal transition rejection
Timestamp persistence
Task API endpoints
Container startup compatibility
Database bootstrap
Repository refactor correctness
```

Verified Lifecycle:

```text
CREATE
↓
ASSIGN
↓
START
↓
COMPLETE
```

Verified Persistence:

```text
created_at
assigned_at
started_at
completed_at
```

stored correctly in PostgreSQL.

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Coordinator creates tasks

✅ Tasks persist in PostgreSQL

✅ Lifecycle transitions function correctly

✅ Illegal transitions are rejected

✅ Task APIs function correctly

✅ Distributed task foundation established
